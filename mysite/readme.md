'polls' is the name of the application I'm working on currently. 
With the help of assignments and documentation, I'm getting familier with the terminologies and the technologies used to deal with Django.


** The concept of CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) is introduced. 

** THINGS GOT UPDATED (7.10.21)

1 ) results.html ( Determine the amount of vote each option gets )

2) details.html ( Intoduced the voting criteria )

3) views.py ( In the vote method, the concept of POST-redirect-GET is introduced eliminating the danger of "resubmission" )

4) urls.py ( The path of vote method gets added )


**THINGS GOT UPDATED (25.10.21)
In our mysite application we previously had 'polls' app but we didn't have a valid (Status code: 200) landing page. 
Now, we have an application 'home' which is serving the landing page of our website.

So, I'm currently working on this one !! ( It would take some time ! )

**THINGS GOT UPDATED(26.12.21)
I have finished working on the autos application.
It is a basic application of data adding to a database, viewing the data, updating and deleting the data from the database. 

This is the final outcome :

( Click the link read as 'Autos CRUD')

The UI needs more effort though !! 

From today on, I have started working on a similar application as 'autos CRUD'. It's called 'cats CRUD'.

**THINGS GOT UPDATED(5.2.22)
I was working on an application named "ads"....for which as per the requirements, I had to change the settings of my "mysite" app. 
So, I am not going to commit anything here...as it would definitly hamper my other applications. 

Here is the link of a github repository where the application have been constructed : 

https://github.com/saksham1991999/django-for-everybody-specialization/tree/master/Django%20Features%20and%20Libraries/Week%205/dj4e/ads

My application is exactly as same as this one.
