'polls' is the name of the application I'm working on currently. 
With the help of assignments and documentation, I'm getting familier with the terminologies and the technologies used to deal with Django.


** The concept of CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) is introduced. 

** THINGS GOT UPDATED (7.10.21)

1 ) results.html ( Determine the amount of vote each option gets )

2) details.html ( Intoduced the voting criteria )

3) views.py ( In the vote method, the concept of POST-redirect-GET is introduced eliminating the danger of "resubmission" )

4) urls.py ( The path of vote method gets added )


**THINGS GOT UPDATED (25.10.21)
In our mysite application we previously had 'polls' app but we didn't have a valid (Status code: 200) landing page. 
Now, we have an application 'home' which is serving the landing page of our website.
